# MISSING_TEXTURE_OUTER_END Resource Pack
MISSING_TEXTURE_OUTER_END is a minecraft resource pack that changes the purplish things from the outer end to resemble missing textures.

This resource pack changes the textures of chorus plants, purpur blocks and shulkers, as well as all resources related to them, to somewhat resemble the classic missing texture.

This was intended to be a companion to the Renderdragon pack, but its also its own thing.

Currently works with version 1.21.8
